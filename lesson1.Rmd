**Observations** Information, including *measurements*, that is collected from organisms of the environment, also known as *data*.

**Data** are used to test *hypotheses*.

In ecology, scientists often to know the **mean**, or average value, of the data collected from different experimental treatments or under different environmental conditions.

**Example study** 

Scientists collected data on the density of herbivorous insects and the amount of leaf tissue the herbivores consumed.

**Oak tree experiment**

Researchers wanted to compare the mean density of insects on caged trees versus uncaged trees to determine whether birds depressed the number of insects consuming tree leaves.

While comparison of the different means describes the central tendencies of the data,
ecologists often want to know if the data used to generate the mean have high or low variability.

If the mean density of insects on leaves was 10 insects per square metero fleaf surface in both of the following sets of data, which group is more variable?

mean(groupA)

mean(groupB)

var(groupA)
